# 🧰 Krishna's Technical Troubleshooting Repository

Welcome to my personal reference repository for solving technical problems across backend development, DevOps workflows, infrastructure setup, and system configuration. This space is designed to document recurring issues, proven solutions, and best practices — so I can debug faster and build smarter.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a living knowledge base to help me:

- Troubleshoot common and complex technical issues
